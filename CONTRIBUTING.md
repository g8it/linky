# Contributing to Linky

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Linky**! This guide will help you set up the project, follow our standards, and submit a pull request.

---

1. **Fork the repository**

2. **Clone your repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/linky.git
   cd linky
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**

   ```bash
   git switch -c your-new-feature
   ```

4. **Make your changes**
    
   You can do this in any text / code editor.

5. **Push and commit your changes**

   First we will add the files and use the `git add` command:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   (DO NOT COMMIT YOUR API KEYS IN THE `firebase.js`, THIS **WILL** MAKE THEM PUBLIC.)

   Now, we will commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "explain your changes here"
   ```

   Finaly, we will push your changes to your new branch:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin your-branch-name
   ```

   ### Making a PR (Pull request)

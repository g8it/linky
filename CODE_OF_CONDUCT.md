# Code of Conduct

Welcome! We want this project to be a space where everyone feels comfortable contributing. To keep things fun, productive, and respectful, we ask all contributors to follow this Code of Conduct.

## Be Respectful

We're all here to learn, share, and build cool stuff. Please treat others with kindness and respect â€” even if you disagree. No personal attacks, name-calling, or harassment of any kind.

## Keep It Friendly

- Use inclusive, welcoming language.
- Assume the best intentions from others.
- Critique code, not people.
- Be constructive, not combative.

## No Tolerance for Hate

Any form of discrimination, hate speech, or exclusionary behavior will result in immediate removal from the project. This includes racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any form of bigotry.

## Spam & Self-Promotion

Please donâ€™t use issues, pull requests, or discussions to spam or promote unrelated projects/services.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please email us at [vencordthemer@outlook.com]. Reports are kept confidential.

## Final Note

We're all human. If someone messes up, give them a chance to improve. Letâ€™s build a great community together. ðŸ’–
